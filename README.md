Python Programming for AI search algorithms

Autonomous car navigation - Using MDP and value iteration to naviagate autonomous cars, calculating maximum points when an obstacle is avoided.

Shelter for homeless - Parking and bed spaces are provided for two communities, choosing the best candidate for a slot thereby optimizing the the spaces available as well as providing shelter for maximum number of people. Implemented using alternate game theory.

Placing cops - Placing cops at certain positions such that avaoid collisions(no two cops are placed on the same diagonal, row or column). Implemented by modifying nqueens problem in recursion for all the possible cases and finding the best possible solution.
